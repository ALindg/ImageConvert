# ImageConvert

This is a small side project of mine that I am intending to use as a means of converting images. This project will be used to directly interface with the images on the byte level and act as a decoder/encoder of various image types. Along with this, the intent is to make it possible to convert from any image type to another.

I am intending on implementing each image conversion as their own separate python file. Classes and methods relating to BMP images will be stored in their respective file - and likewise for other image types, such as JPG or PNG. Please follow this convention should anyone want to contribute to this.
